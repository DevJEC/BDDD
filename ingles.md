Adverbial Clause reduction:

- These clauses which contain subordinating conjunctions are called adverbial clauses.
- They describe or give more information about the independent clause just like an adverb does.
- We can reduce clauses only if the independent and dependent clauses have the same subject.

**Rule 1:**&quot;To be&quot; with these subordinate conjunctions - _although, though, even though, while, if, unless, until, when, whenever_

- Remove the subject
- Remove the verb &quot;to be&quot; + any auxiliary verbs
  - Ex: **When** ~~**she was**~~ **presented with two options,** she picked the one that she liked.

When presented with two options, she picked the one that she liked.

  - Ex: He acted confidently, **although** ~~**he was**~~ **nervous about the presentation.**

He acted confidently, although nervous about the presentation.
